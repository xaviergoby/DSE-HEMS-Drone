**Objective:**     
To design a drone capable of performing a reconnaissance of the law few hundred meters of an approach 
(by a HEMS helicopter) to ensure the operation safety of the approach and the landing of a HEMS helicopter
operating in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC).        


**Description:**    
Drones have evolved significantly in the past years in terms of performance, such as max speed, controllability 
and sensing capabilities. It seems feasible now to imagine a drone which could be deployed by a helicopter to 
perform the functionality of a forward observer to aid in the approach and landing at new, unknown and 
unprepared landing sites. Your task is to design such a system within a HEMS operational environment such that 
minimal visibility landings become viable. Next to the design of the drone, operational procedures should also 
be defined in a safe and robust manner.     

**Context:**    
Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) often frustrate the operation of helicopters, especially with 
regards to approach and landing operations at remote, unknown areas. Drones have evolved significantly in 
the past years in terms of performance, such as max speed, controllability and sensing capabilities. It seems 
feasible now to imagine a drone which could be deployed by a helicopter to perform the functionality of a 
forward observer to aid in the approach and landing at new, unknown and unprepared landing sites. Sensors, such 
as radars used in cars, LIDAR and IR sensors can map the surrounding area in 3D within limited range. Thus, a 
safe approach path and landing site can be explored, and guidance cues can be organised, for the drone making 
a safe approach and landing operation possible even with limited visibility for the “mother” helicopter. The 
key issue is that the criticality of performing such an approach first with a relatively cheap and expendable 
drone is thus reduced dramatically.
